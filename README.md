# Admin Dashboard

## Project Description

This is my admin dashboard project used to practice CSS grid layout, created using HTML and CSS. Some hints of flexbox was also used throughout the project. No functionality in the project as it is purely used to practice design layout placement using grid and flexbox.

## Reflection

I found that I have an easier time laying things out using grid compared to flexbox. Although during the process of styling, I began to see areas where I could either use flexbox or grid. However, I did try to use grid more often than not for the purposes of practice.

The project was fairly straightforward and I had no real difficulty. However, it is exciting to see that my code is way cleaner than when I first started.
